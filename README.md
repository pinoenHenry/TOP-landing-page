Landing Page as a project in the TOP curriculum

This is part of The Odin Project curriculum.
This is a landing page about my passion for travel and discover places around my country and world.

I apply basic knowledge of html and css. The objective is get a proper alignment of each element in the screen using flex box properties.
It has 4 section. The header, one central section with pictures of nature which motivates to travel and other section with a motivational phrase related to this topic. Finally it is the footer with a call to action.
